# motorcycle-canbus-info
Collection of motorcycle CAN hacking resources.

This is a public repo to collect information on how CAN devices talk to each other on various motorcycles.

I own a 2018 Triumph Tiger 1200 XRT. I'll be starting there, but please feel free to raise PRs for other makes and models. It would be nice to have a centralised location of CAN IDs and other hacking related info.
